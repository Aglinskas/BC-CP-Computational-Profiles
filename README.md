To do's:
- Overlay FFA masks over the parcelations, do BNP clusters curve nicely around functional regions?
- Project the clusters means (6 dim gaussian vector) for all subejcts into a common 6-dim space
  - do regions is the same anatomical space have ismilar profiles (anatomy leading function)
  - do regions for the same person have similar profiles (individual differences leading function)
  
 - Grab a functional parcel that is common across subject in anatomical lcoation (like sts,prec, vis cortex), project that parcels vector into 6dim space for all subjects. Do vis cortex profiles cluster more tightly than prec vectors?
